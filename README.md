Task 1 
 Step-by-Step Functionality
- User Input:
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- These inputs are initially stored as strings.
N1 = input("Enter First Number : ")
N2 = input("Enter Second Number : ")
- Type Conversion:
- Converts the string inputs into integers using int().
N1 = int(N1)
N2 = int(N2)
- Arithmetic Operations:
- Performs and prints the result of:
- Addition: N1 + N2
- Subtraction: N1 - N2
- Multiplication: N1 * N2
- Division: N1 / N2 (returns a float)


Task 2

 Step-by-Step Functionality
- User Input:
- Prompts the user to enter their first name and last name.
- Stores the inputs as strings.
input1 = input("Enter your first name : ")
input2 = input("Enter your last name : ")
- String Concatenation:
- Combines the first and last name with a space in between to form the full name.
full_name = input1 + " " + input2
- Personalized Greeting:
- Prints a welcome message using the full name.
print("Hello, ", full_name, "! Welcome to the Python Program.")
